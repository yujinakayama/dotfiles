# String Escapes
#
# Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like the current
# time into messages or file names. The escape character is % with one
# exception: inside of a window's hardstatus ^% (^E) is used instead.
#
# Here is the full list of supported escapes:
#
# %  the escape character itself
# a  either am or pm
# A  either AM or PM
# c  current time HH:MM in 24h format
# C  current time HH:MM in 12h format
# d  day number
# D  weekday name
# f  flags of the window
# F  sets %? to true if the window has the focus
# h  hardstatus of the window
# H  hostname of the system
# l  current load of the system
# m  month number
# M  month name
# n  window number
# s  seconds
# S  session name
# t  window title
# u  all other users on this window
# w  all window numbers and names. With - qualifier: up to the current window;
#    with + qualifier: starting with the window after the current one.
# W  all window numbers and names except the current one
# y  last two digits of the year number
# Y  full year number
# ?  the part to the next %? is displayed only if a % escape inside the part
#    expands to a non-empty string
# :  else part of %?
# =  pad the string to the display's width (like TeX's hfill).
#    If a number is specified, pad to the percentage of the window's width.
#    A 0 qualifier tells screen to treat the number as absolute position.
#    You can specify to pad relative to the last absolute pad position by
#    adding a + qualifier or to pad relative to the right margin by using -.
#    The padding truncates the string if the specified position lies before
#    the current position. Add the L qualifier to change this.
# <  same as %= but just do truncation, do not fill with spaces
# >  mark the current text position for the next truncation. When screen needs
#    to do truncation, it tries to do it in a way that the marked position gets
#    moved to the specified percentage of the output area. (The area starts
#    from the last absolute pad position and ends with the position specified
#    by the truncation operator.) The L qualifier tells screen to mark the
#    truncated parts with ‘...’.
# {  attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next }
# `  Substitute with the output of a `backtick' command. The length qualifier
#    is misused to identify one of the commands. See Backtick.
#
# The c and C escape may be qualified with a 0 to make screen use zero instead
# of space as fill character. The n and = escapes understand a length qualifier
# (e.g. %3n), D and M can be prefixed with L to generate long names, w and W
# also show the window flags if L is given.
#
# An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or the color
# settings. Its format is ‘[attribute modifier] [color description]’.
# The attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type indicator if it can
# be confused with a color description. The following change types are known:
#
# +  add the specified set to the current attributes
# -  remove the set from the current attributes
# !  invert the set in the current attributes
# =  change the current attributes to the specified set
#
# The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or a
# combination of the following letters:
#
# d  dim
# u  underline
# b  bold
# r  reverse
# s  standout
# B  blinking
#
# Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters specifying
# the desired background and foreground color (in that order). The following
# colors are known:
#
# k  black
# r  red
# g  green
# y  yellow
# b  blue
# m  magenta
# c  cyan
# w  white
# d  default color
# .  leave color unchanged
#
# The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors.
# You can also use the pseudo-color ‘i’ to set just the brightness and leave
# the color unchanged.
#
# A one digit/letter color description is treated as foreground or background
# color dependent on the current attributes: if reverse mode is set,
# the background color is changed instead of the foreground color.
# If you don't like this, prefix the color with a ‘.’.
# If you want the same behavior for two-letter color descriptions,
# also prefix them with a ‘.’.
#
# As a special case, ‘%{-}’ restores the attributes and colors that were set
# before the last change was made (i.e. pops one level of the color-change
# stack).
#
# Examples:
#
# ‘G’  set color to bright green
# ‘+b r’  use bold red
# ‘= yd’  clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.
# ‘%-Lw%{= BW}%50>%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%<’  The available windows centered at the
#      current win dow and truncated to the available width. The current
#      window is displayed white on blue. This can be used with
#     ‘hardstatus alwayslastline’.
# ‘%?%F%{.R.}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?’  The window number and title and the window's
#      hardstatus, if one is set. Also use a red background if this is the
#      active focus. Useful for ‘caption string’.
